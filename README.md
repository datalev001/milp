# Solving Complex Business Problems with Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
A Practical Exploration of MILP Applications: From Workforce Optimization to Financial Planning and Beyond
If you're a hedge fund manager managing an investment portfolio, your goal is to maximize returns by year-end. However, you have limits on how much or when you can invest in certain assets. This is where Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) comes in.
I use a practical example - optimizing shift schedules for customer service agents - to show its application. After reading this paper, you may discover many other valuable uses of MILP in your field.
Additionally, this paper will show you how to set up an optimization model, translating real-world problems into mathematical terms when balancing goals and constraints.
